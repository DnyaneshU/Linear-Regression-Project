# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on historical housing data. The goal is to demonstrate how simple regression techniques can effectively analyze and forecast real estate prices.

## 📌 Overview
We use **Linear Regression** to predict house prices using features such as:
- Area (sq. ft.)
- Number of bedrooms/bathrooms
- Year built
- Garage size
- Living area

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Correlation Heatmap: Shows the correlation between numeric features and house price.

- Distribution Plot: Checks for skewness in target variable.

- Scatter Plot: Shows how features like Living Area or Garage Area relate to price.

## 🧠 Model Training

- Train/Test split: 80/20  
- Feature scaling is used where required  

### Model Evaluation
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

    
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  
- **R² Score (Goodness of Fit)**

## 📈 Visualizations

![Confusion Matrix](Plots/linear_regression_results.png)
## Key Insights

- The plot shows predicted house prices vs actual prices with a regression line.
- The red dashed line represents the model’s best linear fit.
- Most data points are scattered far from the line, showing weak predictions.
- A very low R² score (≈ 0.01) indicates the model barely explains the variation in prices.
- Outliers are pulling the line away from the majority of points, reducing accuracy.
- This suggests the model needs better features or a different algorithm to improve performance.

## 🧾 Conclusion
- Linear Regression is effective for predicting housing prices when proper features are selected.

- Good accuracy for initial models, with scope to improve using feature engineering or advanced algorithms.

- Visuals confirm randomness in residuals → Linear Regression assumption holds well.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
-We may add more meaningful features like:

  - Zip Code

  - School rating

  - Neighborhood ranking

- Use Polynomial Regression or Random Forest Regressor for comparison

-Deploy the model with Flask or Streamlit
